# ruby_scrapy_dribbble
Download images from dribbble with your search keywords.

## usage
Install dependency with `bundle install`

You can type in as many keywords you want but the more keywords the less search results. I recommend two keywords.

Then run this script with `ruby ruby_scrapy_dribbble.rb your_keyword1 your_keyword2 your_number`

## require
ruby 2.4+
